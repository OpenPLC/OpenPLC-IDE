  SendDataToMySQL

  Demonstrates storing and reading values in a MySQL database using
  the Temboo Arduino Yún SDK. This example will periodically
  update a MySQL instance with dummy sensor values from the Yún, and
  then read those values back from the database.

  Check out the latest Arduino & Temboo examples and support docs at http://www.temboo.com/arduino

  A Temboo account and application key are necessary to run all Temboo examples.
  If you don't already have one, you can register for a free Temboo account at
  http://www.temboo.com

  To use this example, you'll need a MySQL instance. These instructions
  assume that you are using an Amazon RDS instance in the "US East"
  region. For details on how to use a database hosted elsewhere, see
  http://temboo.com/library/Library/MySQL

  To configure an RDS MySQL instance for Temboo connectivity:

  1. If you don't already have one, create an Amazon AWS account and
  a new MySQL RDS instance. The instructions at
  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html
  will guide you through this process. Be sure to select the "US East (N.  Virginia)"
  region in the dropdown menu in the upper right side of the RDS Management Console
  before creating the new instance.

  2. Configure your RDS instance by adding a security rule to allow access
  by Temboo. If you're familiar with the RDS command line tools,
  you can do so using the instructions at https://www.temboo.com/library/Library/MySQL/
  If you're not familiar with the RDS command line tools, the following steps
  will guide you through this process using a Temboo Choreo:

  -Obtain your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from the "Security Credentials"
  pane of the AWS management console. If you haven't yet created an Access Key, you
  will be able to do so from this interface.

  -Log in to your Temboo account at https://www.temboo.com/login

  -Navigate to https://www.temboo.com/library/Library/Amazon/RDS/AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress/

  -Turn on Run Mode, and enter the following inputs:

    AWSAccessKeyId:          your AWS access key
    AWSSecretKeyId:          your AWS secret key
    CIDRIP:                  (leave empty)
    DBSecurityGroupName:     your RDS DBSecurityGroup name
    EC2SecurityGroupName:    Temboo Access
    EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId: 114370834540

  -Click the "Try it Out" button. If all went well, you should see an XML document
  in the "Output" section of the Choreo description page listing the access permissions
  in your RDS security group. Temboo should now have access to your RDS database.

  3. To run the SendDataToMySQL sketch, you'll need the following information
  about your database. These values can be found on the RDS Management Console:

  -The address of the DB server (eg, somename.abc3xy6ijklmn.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)
  -The database name
  -A username for a user with read, write, and create access to the DB
  -The password for that user

  Substitute these values into the DATABASE_SERVER, DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_USERNAME,
  and DATABASE_PASSWORD constants in the sketch.

  When you run the sketch, it will attempt to create a new table named "readings" in the
  database if it doesn't already exist. The table contains two columns: an unsigned INT
  column named "cpu_time" and an INT column named "sensor_value".

  This example assumes basic familiarity with Arduino sketches, and that your Yún is connected
  to the Internet.

  This example code is in the public domain.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: TembooAccount.h:

  TembooAccount.h is a file referenced by this sketch that contains your Temboo account information.
  You'll need to edit the placeholder version of TembooAccount.h included with this example sketch,
  by inserting your own Temboo account name and app key information. The contents of the file should
  look like:

  #define TEMBOO_ACCOUNT "myTembooAccountName"  // your Temboo account name
  #define TEMBOO_APP_KEY_NAME "myFirstApp"  // your Temboo app key name
  #define TEMBOO_APP_KEY  "xxx-xxx-xxx-xx-xxx"  // your Temboo app key

  You can find your Temboo App Key information on the Temboo website,
  under My Account > Application Keys

  The same TembooAccount.h file settings can be used for all Temboo SDK sketches.

  Keeping your account information in a separate file means you can share the main .ino file without worrying
  that you forgot to delete your credentials.
